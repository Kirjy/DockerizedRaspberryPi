# DockerizedRaspberryPi
A Raspberry PI suite using only dockers that may communicate between each other.

This repo is my current Raspberry Pi configuration. 
It works on Raspberry Pi OS 64 bits. With some slight changes of the mariadb containers, it can work on 32 bits, but I wouldn't recommand it will need old versions to be working.

I'm not a docker expert and I may have done some mistakes. So please, feel free to report any mistake or contact me in case of any remarks.

It provides the clean installation of:
 - A nginx proxy manager as a reverse proxy in order to manage the external accesses to your installation through the 443 port (https) through a nice interface.
   This container has to be launched first as it will also create the frontend network used by the other containers. 
 - Nextcloud for personnal files sharing and management
 - A z2m folder which installs everything needed to use zigbee to mqtt as a broker for your zigbee installation :
   - Mosquitto
   - Zigbee2Mqtt
   - Home Assistant
 - A portainer container in order to have an interface to manage easily your containers. This part is in beta in my installation as containers were created before adding this container.
 - A transmission interface in order to easily download torrents on a local samba share while not at home.

Please note that any sentitive information is described as ${MY_VARIABLE}. These information are stored in a .env file that is stored in the compose.yml folder.
